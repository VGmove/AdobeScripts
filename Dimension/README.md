The script measures the length of the selected lines and creates a measurement symbol from it. The measurements appear in a new layer.

# Installation
You can run the script without installation right away by selecting the menu File → Scripts → Other Script, then Illustrator will ask you to specify the location of the file or drag the script file onto the Illustrator window with the mouse.
